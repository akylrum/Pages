Hi! These characters animations were created for the Call of Sentinels project where I served as Lead Animator. The game was developed by small independent studio A17 Games. For the most part, I worked on gameplay animations for characters, but I was also tasked with animating dialogue and story-driven characters. So, let's start there.

The most handsome character in the game. The nameless General.

These guys below are the main heroes of the game Call of Sentinels by A17Games. Our goal was to create 2D character animations without using 3D animation techniques, aiming for a retro-style ARPG feel. The have a large number of isometric animations, with movement on 8 sides.  



Gothad, The Greenest

The challenge was that the character on screen is quite small, and we couldn't use a large number of bones and complex meshes because there are many characters on screen, and too much detail could significantly impact performance. Therefore, there were many RND moments, trials, tests, and iterations during the animation production process.

I also added other characters and mobs from the game in the video below, showcasing the development process.
