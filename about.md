<h3 class="centered">Hello there! /ᐠ .ᆺ. ᐟ\ﾉ</h3>

I’m Andrey, a freelance artist focused on creating game-ready assets, animations, and game illustrations. I love bringing ideas to life through cozy, cartoony visuals, and I’m always curious to explore new styles and techniques.

Back when my blog was active, I enjoyed sharing my work and free assets with the game dev community. After a long break, I’ve decided to return and continue uploading assets — just like I did before.

I hope you’ll find something useful or inspiring here. Thanks for stopping by!
