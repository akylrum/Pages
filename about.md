    <h2>Hello there! /ᐠ .ᆺ. ᐟ\ﾉ </h2>
    <p>I'm Andrey, a freelance artist focused on creating game-ready assets, animations, and game illustrations. I love bringing ideas to life through cozy, cartoony visuals, and I'm always curious to explore new styles and techniques.</p>
    <p>Back when my blog was active, I enjoyed sharing my work and free assets with the game dev community. After a long break, I’ve decided to return and continue uploading assets — just like I did before.</p>
    <p>I hope you’ll find something useful or inspiring here. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
    <p>💜💜💜</p>


### Biga Projects

Last time I worked on [Call of Sentinels](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2558200/Call_of_Sentinels/) as a lead character animator.
